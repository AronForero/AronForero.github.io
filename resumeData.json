    "bio":"I'm from Bucaramanga-Santander(Colombia), student of systems engineering at Universidad Industrial de Santander, and i am 22 years old. In my free time i usually read about machine learning, deep learning, maths and all of that new technological techniques. My degree project was based in data analytics, and the application of machine learning techniques to predict the scores of one of the most important exams in Colombia(SABER11 exam). I use Linux distributions to work, specifically deepin because i consider it's the most beautiful distro. I have been living a healthy life, and i practice volleyball 4 times at week, and ride my bike everyday.",
